## Goals of this project:

- Implement Kafka in Go
- Protocol compatible with Kafka so Kafka clients and services work with Jocko
- Make operating simpler
- Distribute a single binary
- Use Serf for discovery, Raft for consensus (and remove the need to run ZooKeeper)
- Smarter configuration settings
    - Able to use percentages of disk space for retention policies rather than only bytes and time kept
    - Handling size configs when you change the number of partitions or add topics
- Learn a lot and have fun

## TODO
