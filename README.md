Kafka/distributed commit log service in Go.

## Goals of this project:

- Implement Kafka in Go
- Protocol compatible with Kafka so Kafka clients and services work with Jocko
- Make operating simpler
- Distribute a single binary
- Use Serf for discovery, Raft for consensus (and remove the need to run ZooKeeper)
- Smarter configuration settings
    - Able to use percentages of disk space for retention policies rather than only bytes and time kept
    - Handling size configs when you change the number of partitions or add topics
- Learn a lot and have fun

## TODO

- [x] Producing
- [x] Fetching
- [x] Partition consensus and distribution
- [ ] Protocol
    - [x] Produce
    - [x] Fetch
    - [x] Metadata
    - [x] Create Topics
    - [x] Delete Topics
    - [ ] Consumer group [current task]
- [x] Discovery
- [ ] API versioning [more API versions to implement]
- [ ] Replication [first draft done - testing heavily now]

## Hiatus Writing Book

I’m writing a book for PragProg called Building Distributed Services with Go. [You can sign up on this mailing list and get updated when the book’s available.](http://eepurl.com/dC5-l1) It walks you through building a distributed commit log from scratch. I hope it will help Jocko contributors and people who want to work on distributed services.
